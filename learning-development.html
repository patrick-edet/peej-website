                    <p class="portfolio-text">
                        As a experienced Learning Developer, I specialize in designing scalable, impactful, 
                        and user-centered learning solutions for global organizations. My approach combines 
                        instructional design principles with modern digital tools to create engaging, measurable, 
                        and accessible learning experiences. With a background in both Organisational Development and technology, 
                        I bridge strategic learning needs with effective design execution.

                    <h3>My Approach</h3>

                    <p>
                        Every project begins with deep understanding of the business, the learners, and the 
                        systems involved. I combine design thinking, data insights, and user feedback to ensure 
                        that each learning experience is not just informative but transformative.
