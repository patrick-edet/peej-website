                <p>
                I'm Patrick Edet Effiong Jay (PEEJ), a Learning Design Strategist, UX/UI Designer, and Junior Fullstack developer based in Budapest  
                with 8+ years of experience turning complex problems into intuitive, user-centered solutions. I bring a multidisciplinary 
                edge to my work, combining technical development skills with a deep understanding of how 
                people learn and interact with digital systems. 
                    I've worked with startups, agencies, and enterprise clients to design digital products that feel effortless to use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a diploma in Fullstack Software Development from McMaster University and hands-on experience at global organizations 
                    like British Petroleum and Avis Budget Group, I specialize in designing user-focused learning platforms and applications 
                    that are both functional and engaging. My strengths lie in bridging design thinking with clean code, using tools like Figma,
                    HTML, CSS design frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, JavaScript Frameworks, Typescript, PostgreSQL, setting up database like MongoDB 
                    and Docker to create seamless digital experiences.    
                </p>

                    <p>
                        My background in learning design enables me to build smarter content delivery systems using LMS tools like Cornerstone, 
                        Workday, Degreed and Xyleme ensuring accessibility, performance, and impact at scale. I've led cross-functional projects, 
                        built high-impact learning catalogs, and received multiple awards for stakeholder onboarding and content innovation.

                    <p>
                        Whether I'm prototyping an intuitive interface or building a responsive backend, my focus is always on solving real-world 
                        problems with clarity and creativity. I'm driven by curiosity, collaboration, and a desire to design learning and tech 
                        solutions that truly serve people.

                <p>
                    I believe in a work ethic grounded in integrity, consistency, and accountability. I take 
                    ownership of my responsibilities, deliver high-quality results on time, and continuously 
                    strive to improve. Whether working independently or within a team, I bring a proactive mindset,
                    clear communication, and a commitment to excellence. I value feedback as a tool for growth 
                    and treat every project as an opportunity to learn, lead, and contribute meaningfully.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My personal brand is built around three key core values:
                    <li>Empathy - in how I consider users' needs and how I support my stakeholders</li>
                    <li>Clarity - in how I write code, communicate with teams, and approach design problems</li>
                    <li>Reliability - in the quality of my work and the consistency of my contributions</li>
