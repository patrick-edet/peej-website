                    <h3>My Journey</h3>

                    <p>
                        As a UX/UI Designer, I specialize in crafting seamless and accessible user experiences that
                        blend functionality with visual clarity. My work sits at the intersection of design and 
                        learning, where intuitive interfaces are key to engagement and performance. With a 
                        background in fullstack software development and instructional design, I bring a holistic 
                        perspective to user-centered design.

                    <h3>My UX/UI Philosophy</h3>

                    <p>
                        I believe great design is invisible and it works without the user noticing. I 
                        apply empathy, iteration, and feedback-driven improvements to every design process. 
                        Whether refining a complex LMS interface or prototyping a brand-new user flow, I aim for 
                        clarity, elegance, and impact.
